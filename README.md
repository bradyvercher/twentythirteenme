# Twenty Thirteen ME

A Twenty Thirteen child theme that allows nearly any color to be customized using the Theme Customizer. 

This serves as a concept to demonstrate integration between the Theme Customizer and a bundled LESS compiler in order to deliver an optimized style sheet. Some methods for displaying custom styles require generating all CSS on the server side and printing directly in the document, while others actually load WordPress a second time or create security issues.
